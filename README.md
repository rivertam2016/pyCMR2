# pyCMR2

Python implementation of CMR2 matlab code from:

Lohnas, L. J., Polyn, S. M., & Kahana, M. J. (2015). 
Expanding the scope of memory search: Modeling intralist and interlist effects in free recall. 
Psychological review, 122(2), 337-363.

These files contain:

1. A python version of the CMR2 code used in Lohnas et al. (2015)

2. A .txt file containing the presented stimuli used in Kahana et al. (2002)

3. A .txt file containing the recall outputs from Kahana et al. (2002) 

Files 2-3, as well as the original MATLAB version of this code, are all available 
on the website of the Computational Memory Lab at UPenn.

4. runCMR2.py -- A python script enabling a basic launch of pyCMR2

5. graph_CMR2.py -- Code to reproduce the SPC and PFR curves from Figure 2 in Lohnas et al. (2015).

Faster / more streamlined implementations of this code are in the pipeline. Stay tuned!
