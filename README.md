# pyCMR2
Python implementation of CMR2 matlab code from Lohnas et al. (2015)

These files contain:

1. A python version of the CMR2 code used in Lohnas et al. (2015)

2. A .txt file containing the presented stimuli used in Kahana et al. (2002)

3. A .txt file containing the recall outputs from Kahana et al. (2002) 

Files 2-3, as well as the original MATLAB version of this code, are all available 
on the website of the Computational Memory Lab at UPenn.

4. A python script enabling a basic launch of pyCMR2, with code to reproduce
Figure 2 from Lohnas et al. (2015).
